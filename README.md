# saq_fitness
This project was done as my final assignement at FPT Aptech (Class T1902E)
The project includes an android app that servers the main functions as a follow along training app. Besides, we do host further services, with fees, such as analyzing calories difference, creating workout goal and taking notes for workouts done as well as meals taken in. The main website that provides API and other CSM function can be found here: http://saq.herokuapp.com/
